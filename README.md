## 🧠 The Multi-Agent Intelligence System

MeetSync operates using three core specialized agents that process meeting data in a pipeline to ensure maximum accuracy and depth.

### 1. 📋 The Intelligence Extraction Agent
This agent performs the primary post-meeting analysis, converting audio into high-fidelity structured data.
*   **Deep Summary & Sentiment**: Goes beyond basic notes to capture the emotional tone and outcomes.
*   **Commitment Intelligence**: Automatically identifies promises, obligations, and deliverables.
*   **Risk & Blocker Detection**: Flags potential future problems (risks) versus active progress-preventers (blockers).
*   **Structured Output**: Generates valid JSON intelligence covering decisions, questions raised, and participant intent.

### 2. ⚖️ The Accountability Engine (Agent 3)
The "Brain" of MeetSync's persistence. It compares the current meeting with your organization's entire history.
*   **Historical Alignment**: Syncs current promises with past commitments to check for consistency.
*   **Reliability Scoring**: Assigns a **Reliability Score (0-100)** to participants based on their track record of completing deliverables.
*   **Pattern Recognition**: Detects repeated delays or circular commitments (e.g., the same approval promised in three consecutive meetings).
*   **Escalation Alerts**: Automatically identifies if an overdue task creates a critical downstream launch risk.

### 3. 🎯 The Strategic Preparation Agent
Acts as your personal advisor before you even enter the room.
*   **Executive Briefings**: Summarizes relationship history and project status in 3-5 high-impact sentences.
*   **Recommended Strategy**: Advises on how to approach a meeting based on the participants' historical reliability and open items.
*   **Dynamic Questioning**: Generates "hard questions" to move projects forward based on identified blockers.

## 🚀 Advanced Analysis Features

*   **Interactive Meeting Q&A**: Each recording becomes a searchable knowledge base. Ask "Who agreed to the API change?" or "What was the budget concern?" and get cited answers instantly.
*   **Relationship Intelligence**: Understand participant dynamics over time, including consistency, sentiment trends, and past collaboration hurdles.
*   **Real-time Intelligence Pipeline**: Processes video recordings directly from Stream.io through **Groq's Whisper-large-v3** and **Llama-3.3-70b** for near-instant results.
